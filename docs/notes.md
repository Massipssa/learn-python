- @staticmethod vs @classmethod
    - static to be used when we will never interact with class object
    - method class to be used when we may use inheritance

## Builtin function
- __str__ vs __repr__
    - str: compute informal representation of string (for end user)
    - repr: compute official representation of string (to more precise, for debug and dev)
- **dir**: return list of attributes and methods of any object


## Testing
- mock
